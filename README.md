This repo contains the codes of various standard machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in python.

Observations of each code has been reported in the jupyter notebook itself as a markdown cell.

There are three files for each problem:

1) Python code in .py format
2) Python code as jupyter notebook
3) A pdf generated from the jupyter notebook
